        <p> this is my collection of English-Mandarin-Korean cognates </p>
        <p> This is a list of English-Mandarin-Korean cognates, which I am actively collecting. I grew up speaking both English and Mandarin, and I am currently learning Korean as a beginner. Growing up in America, I wasn’t required to learn Mandarin or Korean, but students in China and South Korea are required to learn English. Although it is known that many Korean words are borrowed from Mandarin (around 50-70% of the words), I was surprised to find that there is less in common than I thought there would be. Instead, I am finding more words that are similar to English. Perhaps it is because I am in a Korean beginner class for English speakers. Sometimes, it’s difficult to say which language is borrowing from which other language.   </p>

            <p> This catalogue is important to me because language switching online is more fluid than learning how to speak a language in real life. You can translate and move between languages with ease. There’s less exclusivity. During periods of Korean history in the 1900s, it was common for magazines to be published in both Mandarin and Korean characters— the Mandarin was meant for men, and the Korean was meant for women. The parts of the magazine about household chores and advertisements about cooking and cleaning would be published in Korean, and the parts about politics and scholarship would be published in Mandarin. Perhaps there are different ways that language can be exclusive now, but the internet has increased accessibility to understanding different languages. </p>
            
            <p>  This page is meant for anyone that speaks English, Mandarin, or Korean, and is learning English, Mandarin, or Korean. </p>
