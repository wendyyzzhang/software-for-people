            <h1>Forbidden Fig Tree</h1>
            <h2> A Fig Tree in Southern France </h2>
            <h3> August 2nd, 2024 </h3>
            <p> I’ve never eaten a fresh fig, but my roommate has— so she recognizes them immediately: wide, lobed leaves so dense that they look sewn, clothing naked figs underneath. I am almost tempted by the hidden figs, which lay far up above brambles and thorns, but I resist. It is a stranger’s backyard. We are not properly dressed for fig- harvesting.</p>
            <p> So, I wait. The next morning, I pull on skin-tight runner’s leggings, douse myself in sunscreen and bug spray, and turbo the electric bike down the hill. Fruit tumbles to the ledge by the road, where Coco and I stand, inspecting the fallen. I pry open foliage, revealing smooshed figs. Fruit flies surround my hand in serpentine coils, as if to warn me from their slimy prey.
            </p>
            <p> I brace myself against the ledge, cross one leg in front of the other. This hill is not a hill. It is a cliff. Pebbles slide underneath my sneakers— I can’t. I am not afraid of plunging rollercoasters, but I am afraid of my own body (it’s surprising that no one, except for my family, has noticed that I always insist on the aisle-side of stairs.)
            </p>
            <p> I lower myself to the road, prepared to return empty-handed. But Coco is already climbing, wedging her foot on a mossy rock, and I can only tell her to be careful with her knee, spotting her from below.</p>
            <p> “Ready?” Coco calls out, head peeking from the bushes. A fist-sized projectile zooms at me, and I leap. Forbidden fruit splats and stains down my elbows, shoulders, lips. <i> Sweet. </i> Salty sunscreen and pasty bug spray linger on my tongue.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sweat runs down my helmet. “Ready?” Coco calls out, but I am not there to catch it. I mourn the mangled fig. I peel it in half, revealing fleshy strands growing like sea anemone with seedy nuclei.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Coco forages on, I count the number of figs: 49, 50, 53. I imagine what the fig will taste like: nothing like the bitter fig-jam that was on our soggy cucumbers last night. Nor the wrinkly re-hydrated figs that tasted like they were marinated in Chiangking black vinegar. I think of how we’ll eat them: fresh-fig cake with creamy Maison-Necty honey frosting? Fig olive tapenade? Or simply plain?
            </p>
            <p>
                It feels almost sacrilegious to eat one without her, but I can’t resist anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seedy juice spills into my mouth. Sweet as a July strawberry fermenting in the sun. Then something moves. <i> Wriggles. </i>  Squirming, tickling my tongue. I shriek and spit. <i> Unlucky,</i> I think.
    
            </p>
            <p>
                Coco and I carry the remainder of the figs to the classroom, where we bathe the fruits of our labor. I pry one open. Wart-colored worms undulate, writhing amidst a sea of fleshy fingers. The longer I look, the more worms I see. Coco splits another fig: worms. Another one: worms. Slowly, our harvest dwindles. Another one: worms. Worms, worms, worms, worms, worms, worms.
